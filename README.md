Voto Como Vamos 2
=================

This is a repository for the new Voto Como Vamos platform. It's a
database-backed Wiki with a few scrapers to gather interesting data
from the many websites the Porto Alegre government offers.

As the data coming from the scrapers is not necessarily uniform,
we chose PostgreSQL with the hstore extension to help with ad-hoc
querying.

Installation and Development
----------------------------

All development is being done inside a [Vagrant][1] box, so you'll 
need it installed and working on your system before you begin. We 
are using a standard [Ubuntu Precise 64 box][2], which you'll need 
to grab and add to your Vagrant inventory:

[1]: http://www.vagrantup.com
[2]: http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box

```
$ vagrant box add precise http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box
```

Let Vagrant do the rest from there (you need to be online for this):

```
$ vagrant up
```

The box should then be booted, updated, provisioned and you'll have
a working version of the application under [localhost:8000][3].

*Note*: provisioning and deployment are still being worked on, so
there will be a few failures. Please help us with pull requests
and bug reports!

Contributing
------------

Most development is being done by the [ThoughtWorks Brasil][4] team,
and they have direct access to this repository (so no pull requests
are necessary in this case), but we are of course open to 
contributions from anyone. We'll periodically scan pull requests and
new or updated issues. Get in touch if you're thinking of making a
big change, though â€“ we might have it in the plans and can probably
help you out.
